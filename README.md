## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

-   [Node (>= v18.18)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quickstart

To get started with Scaffold Alchemy, follow the steps below:

1. Install the latest version of Scaffold Alchemy

```
npx create-web3-dapp@latest
```

2. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```
npm run deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. You can find more information about how to customize your contract and deployment script in our [documentation](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/scaffold-alchemy/smart-contracts).

3. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
npm run dev
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the contract components. You can tweak the app config in your project settings.
